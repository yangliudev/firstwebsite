			<hr class="my-4">
			<p>I was originally born in China but moved to the US state of Hawaii when I was 2 years old. I grew up in Hawaii throughout my childhood years and then moved to the continental US state of California throughout my grades 5-6 years. We resided in a small suburb city south of San Francisco, called Cupertino. After the 2 years in California, my family decided to move again, this time to Vancouver, Canada during my grade 7 year in 2010 when I turned 12. This was the last big move our family had and I have been living here ever since.
